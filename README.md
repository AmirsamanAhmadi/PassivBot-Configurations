# Organization

Files are stored correspondent to their version. Each sub-folder represents a single backtest and / or live_settings file. Configurations are compatible with their major version number, and may or may not be forwards compatible. More information on versioning can be found at the [Passivbot Wiki](https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot_futures/wiki/Versions).

To find configurations for your version of PassivBot, check the associated version number, and find the subfolder for your exchange. Some major versions (ex. v3.1 & v3.3) may not use the same configurations, so keep track of your version!
