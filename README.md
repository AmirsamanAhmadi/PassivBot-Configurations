# Formatting

If you would like to provide backtest information for your configuration, please place all relevant data in a folder with the corresponding name to your Config.
> Ex. 'ByBit\[foldername]\[all files]'

If you have no backtesting information, place the settings.json file into the associated trading pair folder: 
> Ex. 'Binance\LINKUSDT_noBacktest\[{config file]'

 Name your configurations something distinct!

Special Thanks to @enarjord (https://github.com/enarjord)
